All simulations were run using MATLAB R2020b.

To produce Figure 2A, run Fig2_FOSBE2022.m. This script produces the plot plot_PV_overlay.png. To produce the results from Figure 2B, run Fig2_Table_FOSBE2022.m and the table results will be printed to the command window as the model with a local reflex, then the model without a local reflex. The numbers printed are in the order: systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac output, ejection fraction.

To produce the plots in Figure 3, run Fig3_HRandEmax_perturb.m. This produces two sets of plots: Fig3A_AP.png and Fig3B_Vlung.png.
